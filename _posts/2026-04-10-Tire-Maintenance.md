## Tire Maintenance: More Important Than You Think

Your tires are the only contact between your vehicle and the road. Despite this critical role, tires are often the most neglected maintenance item. Many drivers don't check tire pressure, skip rotations, and drive on worn tires until they fail. At AJ Auto Repair in Eustis, FL, we see the consequences of tire neglect daily. The good news? Proper tire maintenance is simple, inexpensive, and dramatically improves safety while saving you money.

### Why Tire Maintenance Matters

Properly maintained tires provide better traction, shorter stopping distances, and more predictable handling. In emergency situations, the difference between good tires and worn tires can be the difference between avoiding an accident and causing one.

Tire maintenance affects fuel economy significantly. Under-inflated tires create more rolling resistance, forcing your engine to work harder and consume more fuel. Properly inflated tires improve gas mileage by 3-4%, saving hundreds of dollars annually.

Regular tire care extends tire life. Tires cost $400-$1,200 per set depending on vehicle type. Doubling tire life through proper maintenance saves substantial money over your vehicle's lifetime. Simple practices like rotation, alignment, and pressure checks make tires last much longer.

### Checking Tire Pressure: The Most Important Maintenance Task

Tire pressure affects everything: safety, fuel economy, tire wear, and handling. Yet most drivers rarely check pressure or only check when a tire looks low. This approach is dangerous and expensive.

Check tire pressure monthly, including your spare tire. Use a quality tire pressure gauge - the cheap stick gauges are often inaccurate. Check pressure when tires are cold, meaning the vehicle hasn't been driven for at least three hours. Driving heats tires and increases pressure, giving false readings.

Your vehicle's correct tire pressure is listed on a sticker inside the driver's door jamb, not on the tire sidewall. The number on the tire is maximum pressure, not recommended pressure. Most passenger vehicles require 30-35 PSI, but check your specific vehicle's requirements.

Under-inflated tires are the most common problem we see. Low pressure causes excessive heat buildup, premature wear on tire edges, reduced fuel economy, and increased risk of tire failure. Even 5 PSI low significantly increases wear and reduces performance.

Over-inflated tires are less common but equally problematic. High pressure causes harsh ride quality, excessive wear in the center of the tread, and reduced traction. Over-inflated tires are more susceptible to damage from potholes and road debris.

Florida's temperature extremes affect tire pressure. Pressure drops about 1 PSI for every 10-degree temperature decrease. Winter mornings in Central Florida can be 30-40 degrees cooler than summer afternoons, causing significant pressure fluctuations. Check pressure regularly throughout the year.

### Understanding Tire Tread Depth

Tread depth determines your tires' ability to evacuate water and maintain traction. New tires have 10/32" to 12/32" of tread. As tires wear, tread depth decreases, reducing performance in wet conditions.

The legal minimum tread depth in Florida is 2/32". However, tires become unsafe long before reaching this limit. We recommend replacing tires at 4/32" tread depth for optimal safety, especially in Florida's frequent rain.

The penny test provides a quick tread depth check. Insert a penny into the tread with Lincoln's head upside down. If you can see the top of Lincoln's head, your tires are below 2/32" and must be replaced immediately. For better safety, use a quarter. If you can see the top of Washington's head, your tires are at or below 4/32" and should be replaced soon.

Uneven wear patterns indicate problems beyond normal tire wear. Edge wear suggests under-inflation. Center wear indicates over-inflation. Wear on one edge points to alignment problems. Cupping or scalloped wear means suspension issues. These patterns tell us what's wrong with your vehicle and should prompt immediate inspection.

### Tire Rotation: Simple Service, Big Benefits

Tire rotation moves tires to different positions to equalize wear. Front tires wear faster than rear tires on front-wheel-drive vehicles. Rear tires wear faster on rear-wheel-drive vehicles. Regular rotation ensures all tires wear evenly, extending their life significantly.

Rotate tires every 5,000-7,000 miles or at every other oil change. This simple service costs little or nothing when combined with other maintenance. The typical rotation pattern depends on your vehicle type and whether tires are directional or non-directional.

Front-wheel-drive vehicles typically use a forward cross pattern: front tires move straight back, rear tires move to opposite front positions. Rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive vehicles often use a rearward cross pattern. Directional tires can only rotate front to back on the same side.

Skipping rotations costs money. Your front tires might be worn out while rear tires have 50% tread remaining. You're forced to buy four new tires instead of getting full life from all positions. Regular rotation means all four tires wear out simultaneously, maximizing your investment.

### Wheel Alignment: Invisible but Critical

Wheel alignment ensures your tires point in the correct direction and contact the road properly. Misalignment causes rapid, uneven tire wear and poor handling. Your vehicle pulls to one side, the steering wheel sits crooked, and tires develop unusual wear patterns.

Alignment problems develop gradually from hitting potholes, curbs, or speed bumps. Even normal driving slowly knocks alignment out of specification. We recommend alignment checks annually or whenever you notice pulling, steering wheel vibration, or uneven tire wear.

Alignment service adjusts camber (tire tilt when viewed from the front), caster (tire tilt when viewed from the side), and toe (whether tires point inward or outward). Modern vehicles require computerized alignment equipment for accuracy. Our alignment service includes before and after measurements showing exactly what was corrected.

Signs you need alignment include vehicle pulling to one side, steering wheel not centered when driving straight, uneven or rapid tire wear, and steering wheel vibration at highway speeds. Address these symptoms immediately to prevent expensive tire replacement.

### When to Replace Tires

Replace tires when tread depth reaches 4/32" for optimal safety, or 2/32" minimum. Replace tires showing signs of aging including cracks in the sidewall, visible cords or fabric, or bulges and blisters on the sidewall. Age matters regardless of tread depth. Rubber degrades over time even if the tire isn't driven. Most manufacturers recommend replacing tires after six years regardless of appearance. Check the DOT code on your tire sidewall - the last four digits indicate manufacture week and year.

Replace tires in pairs or sets of four. Replacing a single tire creates handling imbalances and different traction levels. If your vehicle is all-wheel-drive, replacing one or two tires can damage the drivetrain due to diameter differences. Always consult your owner's manual for AWD tire replacement requirements.

Tire repairs are acceptable for punctures in the tread area smaller than 1/4". Sidewall damage cannot be repaired safely. Multiple repairs weaken the tire structure. If you've repaired a tire twice, replacement is safer than a third repair.

### Tire Selection: Finding the Right Tires

Choose tires appropriate for your driving conditions and vehicle type. Florida drivers need tires that handle heat, rain, and occasional cold weather. All-season tires work well for most drivers, providing good year-round performance.

Consider your priorities: tire life, wet traction, ride comfort, or performance. Budget tires cost less initially but wear faster and provide less traction. Premium tires cost more but last longer and perform better. Over the tire's life, premium tires often cost less per mile.

Match your vehicle's original equipment tire size. Using incorrect sizes affects speedometer accuracy, handling, and clearance. Your owner's manual lists acceptable tire sizes. We can recommend quality tires appropriate for your vehicle and driving style.

### Seasonal Tire Considerations for Florida

Florida's summer heat is brutal on tires. High temperatures accelerate rubber degradation and increase the risk of blowouts. Check pressure more frequently in summer - hot pavement further increases tire temperature and pressure.

Summer thunderstorms create hydroplaning conditions. Worn tires cannot evacuate water effectively, increasing accident risk. Ensure adequate tread depth before summer rainy season begins.

Winter in Central Florida rarely requires special tires, but occasional cold mornings affect tire pressure. Check pressure after temperature drops and adjust as needed. Cold weather reduces tire pressure, which returns to normal as temperatures rise throughout the day.
