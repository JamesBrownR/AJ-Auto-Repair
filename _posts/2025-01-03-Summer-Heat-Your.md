## Summer Heat & Your A/C System: What You Need to Know

Living in Florida means dealing with brutal summer heat that can turn your car into an oven within minutes. Your vehicle's air conditioning system isn't just about comfort—it's about safety. Driving in extreme heat without functioning A/C can lead to heat exhaustion, reduced concentration, and dangerous driving conditions. At AJ Auto Repair, we handle countless A/C repairs every summer, and most could have been prevented with proper maintenance and early intervention.

### How Your Car's A/C System Works

Understanding the basics of your A/C system helps you identify problems early. Your car's air conditioning system uses refrigerant to absorb heat from inside your vehicle and release it outside. The system includes several key components: the compressor, condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve.

The compressor is the heart of the system, powered by your engine through a belt. It pressurizes the refrigerant and circulates it through the system. The condenser, located in front of your radiator, cools the hot refrigerant. The evaporator, inside your dashboard, is where the magic happens—refrigerant absorbs heat from the air blown into your cabin, creating cold air.

When any component fails or refrigerant levels drop, your entire system stops working efficiently. In Florida's heat, this becomes apparent very quickly.

### Common A/C Problems in Hot Climates

**Refrigerant Leaks:** The most common A/C problem we see. Refrigerant doesn't get "used up"—if levels are low, you have a leak. Small leaks in hoses, seals, or connections can develop over time, especially with Florida's temperature extremes and humidity.

**Compressor Failure:** The compressor works hardest during summer months. If you don't use your A/C regularly during winter (yes, even in Florida), seals can dry out and fail when you need it most. Compressor replacement is expensive, so prevention is key.

**Clogged Condenser:** Your condenser sits behind the front grille, exposed to road debris, bugs, and dirt. Over time, buildup restricts airflow, reducing cooling efficiency. Regular cleaning can prevent this issue.

**Electrical Issues:** A/C systems have multiple sensors, relays, and switches. Florida's humidity can cause corrosion in electrical connections, leading to intermittent failures or complete system shutdown.

**Blower Motor Problems:** Even if refrigerant is flowing properly, a failing blower motor means no air circulation. You'll feel weak airflow or hear unusual noises from your vents.

### Warning Signs Your A/C Needs Service

- Air coming from vents isn't as cold as it used to be
- Strange smells when A/C is running (musty or sweet odors)
- Unusual noises when you turn on the A/C
- Water pooling under your car (more than normal condensation)
- A/C works intermittently or only when you're driving, not idling
- Visible moisture or frost on A/C components

### Preventive Maintenance Tips

Regular maintenance can keep your A/C running efficiently and help you avoid expensive repairs. Run your A/C at full blast for 10 minutes every week, even during winter. This keeps refrigerant circulating and prevents seals from drying out.

Replace your cabin air filter regularly. A clogged filter restricts airflow and makes your system work harder. In dusty or pollen-heavy areas, change it every 12,000 miles or annually.

Have your A/C system professionally inspected before summer hits. At AJ Services, we check refrigerant levels, inspect for leaks, test pressure, and ensure all components are functioning properly. Catching small issues early prevents breakdowns during the hottest months.

Park in the shade whenever possible. Direct sunlight heats your interior to dangerous levels, making your A/C work much harder. Use a windshield sun shade to reduce interior temperatures.

### Florida-Specific Tip

Before cranking your A/C to maximum, roll down your windows for 30 seconds to let superheated air escape. This reduces the temperature differential your A/C has to overcome, making it work more efficiently and cool your car faster.

### When to Call a Professional

Some A/C maintenance you can handle yourself, but most repairs require professional equipment and expertise. Modern A/C systems are complex and contain pressurized refrigerant that requires special handling and certification.

If your A/C isn't blowing cold air, don't just keep adding refrigerant. This indicates a leak that needs professional diagnosis and repair. Continuously adding refrigerant without fixing the leak wastes money and harms the environment.

Strange noises, burning smells, or visible damage to components all require immediate professional attention. Continuing to run a damaged A/C system can cause additional damage to expensive components like the compressor.

At AJ Auto Repair, we have the diagnostic equipment to pinpoint exactly what's wrong with your A/C system. We use quality parts, properly evacuate and recharge systems according to manufacturer specifications, and test thoroughly before returning your vehicle. We service both foreign and domestic vehicles and can handle everything from simple recharges to complete system rebuilds.

### The Cost of Neglect

Ignoring A/C problems doesn't make them go away—it makes them more expensive. A small refrigerant leak that costs a few hundred dollars to fix can lead to compressor failure that costs over a thousand dollars. Running your A/C with low refrigerant forces the compressor to work harder, generating excessive heat that damages seals and internal components.

Beyond cost, there's the safety factor. Driving in extreme heat without functioning A/C affects your concentration and reaction time. Studies show that driving in temperatures above 95°F significantly increases accident risk due to heat-related impairment.

### Don't Sweat It This Summer

Get your A/C system inspected before the heat becomes unbearable. We'll make sure you stay cool all summer long.
