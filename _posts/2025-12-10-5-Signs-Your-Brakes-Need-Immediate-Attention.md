## 5 Signs Your Brakes Need Immediate Attention

Your brakes are the most critical safety system in your vehicle. When they fail, the consequences can be catastrophic. Unfortunately, many drivers ignore warning signs until it's too late. At AJ Auto Repair, we've seen countless cases where early intervention could have prevented dangerous situations and saved drivers money on extensive repairs. Here are five unmistakable signs that your brakes need professional attention right now.

### 1. Squealing or Grinding Noises

If you hear high-pitched squealing when you apply the brakes, your brake pads are likely worn down to their metal wear indicators. This squealing is intentionally designed to alert you that it's time for new pads. Ignore it, and you'll soon hear grinding metal-on-metal contact, which means you're damaging your rotors.

Grinding sounds indicate that the brake pad material has worn completely away, and the metal backing plate is now scraping against the rotor. This not only reduces your stopping power dramatically but also causes expensive rotor damage that could have been avoided with timely pad replacement.

### 2. Soft or Spongy Brake Pedal

A healthy brake pedal should feel firm and responsive. If your pedal feels soft, spongy, or sinks to the floor when you press it, you likely have air in the brake lines or a brake fluid leak. This is a serious safety issue that requires immediate professional attention.

Air in the brake lines compresses when you apply pressure, reducing the hydraulic force that stops your vehicle. A brake fluid leak can lead to complete brake failure. Either way, this isn't something to put off until next week. Get your vehicle to a trusted mechanic immediately.

### 3. Vehicle Pulls to One Side

When you brake and your vehicle consistently pulls to the left or right, it indicates uneven braking force. This could be caused by a stuck brake caliper, uneven brake pad wear, or contaminated brake fluid. In Florida's humid climate, moisture in brake fluid is particularly common and can lead to corrosion in brake components.

A pulling vehicle makes emergency stops dangerous because you'll need to fight the steering wheel to maintain control. This problem typically worsens over time and can lead to premature tire wear on one side of your vehicle.

### 4. Vibration or Pulsation When Braking

If you feel pulsating or vibration through the brake pedal or steering wheel when you brake, your rotors are likely warped. Rotors can warp from excessive heat, improper installation, or aggressive driving. Warped rotors create an uneven surface that causes the pulsating sensation.

While warped rotors might seem like a minor annoyance, they significantly reduce your braking efficiency. In an emergency stop, every fraction of a second and every foot of stopping distance matters. Warped rotors also accelerate brake pad wear, leading to more frequent replacements.

### 5. Warning Light on Dashboard

Modern vehicles have sophisticated brake monitoring systems. If your brake warning light illuminates, it's detecting a problem that needs attention. This could indicate low brake fluid, worn brake pads, or a malfunction in the anti-lock braking system.

Never ignore a brake warning light. Even if your brakes seem to be working fine, the warning light indicates that your vehicle's computer has detected an issue that could lead to brake failure. Bring your vehicle in for a diagnostic check as soon as possible.

### Safety First

If you experience any of these symptoms, especially a soft brake pedal or warning lights, don't delay getting your brakes inspected. Your safety and the safety of others on the road depends on properly functioning brakes. At AJ Services, we offer comprehensive brake inspections and can diagnose issues quickly and accurately.

Regular brake maintenance is far less expensive than major repairs caused by neglect. We recommend having your brakes inspected at least once a year, or more frequently if you drive in stop-and-go traffic, tow heavy loads, or frequently drive in hilly terrain.
